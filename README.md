# Naglfar

> Assembled from the unglamorous remnants — tokens, radii, deprecated variants — into something seaworthy enough to carry everything we've built into battle. Naglfar doesn't survive Ragnarök. It delivers.

The design system home for the Norse Architecture — **`Norse.DesignSystem`**. Every design system eventually gets replaced; that's not a flaw to design around, it's the premise. Naglfar isn't built to outlive itself — it's built to deliver everything else to where it's going.

## Status

The token pipeline is live — `@norsearchitecture/design-tokens`, built with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), publishes to GitHub Packages. Colors, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, and a first pass at component tokens (button/input/card) build into CSS custom properties, a JS module, flattened JSON, and a generated C# seed (`FluentTokenSeed`) for FluentUI Blazor's `DesignTokens`.

**The palette is provisional, not final brand taste.** It exists to prove the pipeline works end to end and is expected to be replaced once real design expertise is brought in — see `Glitnir/docs/Naglfar/specs/2026-07-09-style-dictionary-tokens-design.md` for the full design and that standing caveat.

**Naglfar is JS-first, with one 100%-generated .NET exception.** `DesignSystem.Tokens` packs the pipeline's C# seed (`FluentTokenSeed`) and CSS static asset as `Norse.DesignSystem.Tokens`, versioned identically to `@norsearchitecture/design-tokens` — no hand-authored C# anywhere in this repo. `DesignSystem.Stories` — the content-only Razor Class Library of `.stories.razor` catalog pages that Yggdrasil's BlazingStory host (`Hosting.Stories.Client`/`.Server`) consumes — moved to its own repo, [Bragi](https://github.com/NorseArchitecture/Bragi), the same day it landed here. Naglfar ships the token pipeline; Bragi ships the component story catalog.

## The cosmos

Naglfar rides as a submodule of [Bifröst](https://github.com/NorseArchitecture/Bifrost), the Norse Architecture's meta-repository, alongside every other realm. How design work here gets recorded — standalone, or threaded through Glitnir's design court like the rest of the platform — is still open, left that way on purpose until there's real work to decide it for.
